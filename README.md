ES2_iOS
=======

** Project is obsolete using the new Cinder glnext which has ES2 support  **

iOS ES2 project with partial support for Cinder

Started from the basic XCode OpenGL ES2 project and included boost & Cinder
Currently supporting:
- a color render for trimesh & lines.
- texture rendering through trimesh
- basic multitouch support
- screen rotation
- working timeline

So really basic at the moment.
Most stuff is implemented when needed.

Don't forget to set your cinder_path in the project settings
