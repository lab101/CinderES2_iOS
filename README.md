CinderES2_iOS
=============

iOS ES2 project with partial support for Cinder

Started from the basic XCode OpenGL ES2 project and included boost & Cinder
Currently supporting:
- a color render for trimesh & lines.
- texture rendering through trimesh
- basic multitouch support

So really basic at the moment.

only tested on iphone
